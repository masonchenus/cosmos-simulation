# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
mason@cosmos-simulation.example.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public
or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

a mistake, acknowledge it and work to correct it.

### Issue Tracking Guidelines

Our issue tracking system is the primary place for discussing bugs, features,
and improvements. When creating or responding to issues, please follow these
guidelines:

  Search Before Creating  : Before creating a new issue, search to see if a
similar issue already exists. If it does, contribute to the existing discussion
rather than creating a duplicate.

  Provide Detailed Information  : When reporting bugs, provide as much relevant
information as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual
behavior, and your environment details.

  Use Appropriate Labels  : Help us categorize issues by using appropriate
labels when creating or editing issues. This helps prioritize work and find
relevant issues.

  Stay on Topic  : Keep discussions focused on the specific issue at hand.
Side conversations can be moved to new issues or discussion forums as needed.

  Follow Up  : If you're working on an issue, keep the community updated on
your progress. If circumstances prevent you from continuing work, communicate
this so others can pick up where you left off.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Pull requests are the primary mechanism for contributing code to the project.
When creating or reviewing pull requests, please follow these guidelines:

  Create Focused Pull Requests  : Each pull request should address a single,
well defined concern. Large, sprawling pull requests are difficult to review
and more likely to contain bugs.

  Write Clear Descriptions  : Provide clear descriptions of what your pull
request does and why. Include any relevant context, such as related issues or
design decisions.

  Keep Pull Requests Updated  : If your pull request needs changes based on
feedback, update it promptly. Outdated pull requests can block other work and
create confusion.

  Respond to Feedback  : When reviewers provide feedback, respond to it
promptly. If you disagree with feedback, explain your reasoning
constructively.

  Be Patient with Reviews  : Code reviews take time, especially for complex
changes. Be patient and use the feedback to improve both your code and your
skills.

### Code Review Etiquette

Code review is a collaborative process aimed at improving code quality. Both
authors and reviewers should approach code review constructively:

  For Reviewers  :
* Be specific and constructive in your feedback
* Distinguish between personal preferences and objective issues
* Acknowledge good work alongside suggestions for improvement
* Explain the reasoning behind your suggestions
* Focus on the code, not the person

  For Authors  :
* Approach reviews with an open mind
* Ask clarifying questions when you don't understand feedback
* Explain your design decisions when needed
* Don't take feedback personally
* Thank reviewers for their input

## Technical Standards

### Code Style and Conventions

Consistent code style makes the codebase more readable and maintainable. Our
project follows established conventions for each programming language we use:

  JavaScript Standards  : We follow modern JavaScript conventions, using ES6+
features where appropriate. We use meaningful variable and function names,
consistent indentation, and comprehensive comments for complex logic.

  Documentation Standards  : All public functions, classes, and modules should
include JSDoc or equivalent documentation. Inline comments should explain the
why, not the what, of complex code.

  Testing Standards  : New features should include appropriate unit tests.
Bug fixes should include tests that verify the fix and prevent regression.

### Scientific Accuracy

As a scientific simulation, accuracy is paramount. Contributors should:

  Verify Data Sources  : When adding or modifying astronomical data, verify
against authoritative sources such as NASA, JPL, or published astronomical
catalogs.

  Document Uncertainties  : When exact values are unknown or uncertain, document
this clearly. Provide estimates and cite sources when possible.

  Test Rendering Accuracy  : Visual representations should accurately reflect
relative sizes, positions, and movements. Any simplifications or artistic
liberties should be documented.

  Update with New Data  : As scientific understanding evolves, we should update
our data and models accordingly. Contributors are encouraged to track relevant
research and propose updates.

### Performance Considerations

A smooth simulation requires attention to performance. Contributors should:

  Consider Resource Usage  : Be mindful of CPU, memory, and GPU usage,
especially for rendering calculations and real time updates.

  Optimize Appropriately  : Don't optimize prematurely, but do consider
performance implications when designing new features. Profile code before and
after optimizations.

  Handle Edge Cases  : Ensure code handles edge cases gracefully without
causing performance spikes or crashes.

  Document Performance Characteristics  : When introducing new features,
document any performance considerations or known limitations.

## Development Workflow

### Overview

The Cosmos Simulation project follows a structured development workflow that
ensures code quality, proper review, and smooth collaboration among contributors.
Understanding and following this workflow is essential for anyone who wishes
to contribute meaningfully to the project.

### Development Cycle

Our development follows a continuous integration approach with regular release
cycles. Development occurs on feature branches that are merged into the main
branch after thorough review and testing. We maintain a stable main branch that
always contains production ready code, while development work happens on
dedicated branches.

Feature development follows a predictable pattern: first, the feature or fix
is discussed and agreed upon in issues or design documents. Then, a branch is
created from main, development work is completed with appropriate testing,
and finally, the branch is submitted for review and merging.

### Development Environment Setup

Setting up a proper development environment is crucial for effective
contribution. Contributors should ensure they have the following configured:
Node.js and npm for JavaScript development, Git for version control, a modern
code editor with appropriate extensions, and any project specific tools
detailed in our documentation.

We recommend configuring line ending handling for cross platform compatibility,
setting up pre commit hooks for code quality checks, and熟悉 our build and
test scripts before making significant contributions.

### Continuous Integration

All contributions go through our continuous integration pipeline, which
includes automated testing, linting, and build processes. Contributions that
fail CI checks will not be merged until all issues are resolved.

The CI pipeline runs the full test suite, performs static code analysis,
checks code formatting compliance, builds the project for all supported
platforms, and validates documentation changes. Contributors should run these
checks locally before submitting their work to avoid unnecessary CI failures.

## Documentation Standards

### Purpose and Scope

Documentation is a critical part of the Cosmos Simulation project. Good
documentation helps users understand the simulation, assists developers in
understanding the codebase, and ensures the long term sustainability of the
project. All contributors are expected to contribute to documentation as
part of their contributions.

### Types of Documentation

The project maintains several categories of documentation: user facing
documentation that explains how to use the simulation, API documentation
that describes code interfaces and behavior, developer documentation that
guides new contributors through setup and contribution processes, and design
documentation that explains architectural decisions and trade offs.

Each type of documentation serves a distinct audience and purpose. When
contributing documentation, consider who your primary audience is and what
they need to understand.

### Documentation Style

All documentation should be clear, concise, and technically accurate. Use
consistent formatting throughout, including heading hierarchy, code formatting,
and terminology. Write in complete sentences with proper grammar, and avoid
unnecessary jargon unless it serves a specific technical purpose.

Code examples in documentation should be working and tested. If documenting
an API, include realistic usage examples that demonstrate common patterns.
When documenting complex concepts, start with a high level overview before
diving into details.

### Keeping Documentation Current

Outdated documentation is often worse than no documentation, as it can mislead
users and developers. When making changes that affect functionality, update
or note the documentation implications in your pull request. Flag known
documentation issues in issues so they can be addressed systematically.

## Testing Requirements

### Why Testing Matters

As a scientific simulation, the Cosmos Simulation project has a responsibility
to produce accurate and reliable results. Testing is not optional—it is a
fundamental requirement for all contributions. Thorough testing helps catch
bugs early, prevents regression when changes are made, and provides confidence
that the simulation behaves as expected.

### Test Types

The project employs several levels of testing to ensure quality. Unit tests
verify that individual functions and components work correctly in isolation.
Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly.
End to end tests verify that the complete simulation behaves correctly from
a user's perspective. Performance tests ensure that the simulation maintains
acceptable performance characteristics.

Each type of test serves a different purpose and catches different classes
of problems. Contributions should include appropriate tests at multiple levels
whenever possible.

### Test Coverage

While we do not mandate specific coverage percentages, contributors should
strive for comprehensive test coverage of their changes. Critical functionality
should have near complete coverage. Bug fixes should include tests that verify
the fix and prevent regression. New features should include tests for all
public interfaces and important internal logic.

### Writing Good Tests

Good tests are reliable, readable, and maintainable. They should fail only
when actual problems exist, not due to timing issues, environment differences,
or test interdependencies. Tests should be easy to understand, with clear
names and structure. They should be maintainable, with shared setup and
teardown handled appropriately.

Avoid testing implementation details when possible; instead, test observable
behavior. This makes tests more resilient to refactoring and more useful as
regression detectors.

## Security Guidelines

### Security First Approach

Security is a fundamental concern for any software project. The Cosmos
Simulation project, while primarily an educational and scientific tool,
still must handle security considerations thoughtfully. All contributors
should adopt a security first mindset when developing and reviewing code.

### Handling Sensitive Data

The project should never expose sensitive data such as API keys, passwords,
personal information, or internal system details. If contributions require
handling sensitive data, they must include appropriate protection mechanisms
and documentation of security considerations.

When in doubt about whether something should be included in the repository,
consult with maintainers before proceeding. It is easier to prevent a security
issue than to remediate one after it has been introduced.

### Dependency Security

Regularly review and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
Use tools like npm audit or equivalent dependency scanning tools to identify
vulnerable packages. When vulnerabilities are found in dependencies, prioritize
updating to secure versions.

Avoid introducing new dependencies when existing ones meet the need, as each
dependency is a potential security liability. When new dependencies are
necessary, review their maintenance status, security history, and community
adoption before adoption.

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, do not report it in
public forums or issue trackers. Instead, contact the project leads directly
at security@cosmos simulation.example.com. This allows the team to assess and
address the vulnerability before it can be exploited.

## Accessibility Standards

### Commitment to Accessibility

The Cosmos Simulation project is committed to being accessible to all users,
including those with disabilities. We believe that scientific exploration
should be available to everyone, regardless of physical abilities.

### Visual Accessibility

The simulation should be usable by people with various visual abilities.
This includes providing sufficient color contrast, avoiding reliance on color
alone to convey information, supporting screen readers where applicable, and
allowing customization of visual elements such as size and contrast.

When adding visual features, consider how users with color blindness,
low vision, or other visual impairments will experience them. Provide text
alternatives for visual information where possible.

### Interaction Accessibility

Users should be able to interact with the simulation using various input
methods. This includes keyboard navigation for all major features, support
for assistive technologies, and consideration of users with motor impairments
who may have difficulty with precise inputs or rapid reactions.

### Documentation Accessibility

All documentation should be accessible to screen readers and other assistive
technologies. Use proper heading structure, provide alt text for images, and
ensure that code examples are accessible to users with visual impairments.

## Internationalization

### Supporting Multiple Languages

The Cosmos Simulation project aims to be accessible to a global audience.
This includes supporting multiple languages in the user interface, documentation,
and any user facing text. Internationalization (i18n) considerations should
be part of all contributions that affect users.

### String Management

All user facing strings should be externalized and marked for translation.
Avoid embedding strings directly in code. Use the project's internationalization
framework consistently, and follow established patterns for pluralization,
gender, and other linguistic considerations.

When adding new user facing strings, provide them in English as the project's
primary language, with clear context for translators. Avoid idioms, slang,
or culturally specific references that may not translate well.

### Localization Process

The project maintains translation files for supported languages. Contributors
can propose new translations or improvements to existing ones. Translations
should be reviewed by speakers of the target language for accuracy and
naturalness.

### Cultural Considerations

Be aware that users from different cultures may have different expectations
and conventions. Date and time formats, number formatting, and other
locale specific elements should adapt to user preferences. Avoid assumptions
about user location or preferences based on language alone.

## Release Management

### Release Philosophy

The Cosmos Simulation project follows a predictable release schedule to
provide users with regular updates and to manage the project's evolution
effectively. Releases include new features, bug fixes, and improvements
to existing functionality.

### Release Types

We distinguish between major releases, minor releases, and patch releases.
Major releases may include breaking changes and significant new features.
Minor releases add new features in a backward compatible manner. Patch
releases contain bug fixes and security updates only.

### Release Process

Releases follow a defined process that includes feature freeze periods,
testing phases, documentation updates, and announcement preparation. The
process ensures that releases are well tested and that users are properly
informed about changes.

Contributors should be aware of upcoming release schedules when planning
their contributions, particularly for changes that should be included in
specific releases.

### Version Numbering

The project follows semantic versioning (SemVer) for release numbering. This
communicates the nature of changes in each release and helps users understand
the compatibility implications of updating.

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branch

The main branch always contains production ready code. It is protected and
can only be updated through approved pull requests. Direct commits to main
are not allowed except by project maintainers in exceptional circumstances.

### Feature Branches

Feature branches are created for all substantive changes. Branch names should
be descriptive and follow a consistent format. For example, feature branches
might be named "feature/short description" or "fix/issue description".

### Release Branches

Release branches are created when preparing a new release. They allow for
final testing and bug fixes without disrupting ongoing development on main.
Release branches are named with the release version they will produce.

### Branch Lifecycle

Branches should be short lived and merged promptly after review. Long lived
branches create merge conflicts and complicate development. If a branch
cannot be merged quickly, communicate the reason and expected timeline to
the team.

## Commit Message Conventions

### Why Commit Messages Matter

Good commit messages are essential for understanding the history of the
project, troubleshooting issues, and collaborating effectively. Well written
commits make it easier to review changes, find when bugs were introduced,
and understand the rationale behind decisions.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should consist of a subject line and an optional body.
The subject line should be a short summary (50 characters or less) of the
change, written in the imperative mood. The body, when present, should
explain what changed and why, separated by a blank line from the subject.

### Subject Line Guidelines

Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature"). Capitalize the
first letter. Do not end with a period. Focus on what the commit does, not
why it was made—that context belongs in the body if needed.

### Commit Size

Each commit should represent a single logical change. Related changes can
be grouped in a single commit if they are small and truly inseparable.
Avoid making large commits that mix multiple concerns, as this makes review
and rollback more difficult.

### Atomic Commits

Prefer atomic commits that do one thing well. This makes it easier to
understand changes, find bugs, and selectively apply or revert commits.
If a change affects multiple files to implement a single feature, those
changes can reasonably be in one commit.

## Issue Labeling System

### Purpose of Labels

Labels help organize and prioritize issues in the repository. Consistent
label usage makes it easier to find relevant issues, track project progress,
and understand the state of the codebase.

### Label Categories

The project uses several categories of labels: type labels indicate the
kind of issue (bug, feature, documentation, etc.), status labels indicate
where the issue stands (confirmed, in progress, blocked, etc.), priority
labels indicate importance and urgency, and area labels indicate which
part of the project the issue affects.

### Label Definitions

Contributors should understand the meaning of each label and apply them
appropriately. When creating or editing issues, add relevant labels to
help with organization. When working on issues, update their status labels
as progress is made.

### Label Consistency

Use existing labels rather than creating new ones. If you believe a new
label is necessary, discuss it with maintainers before creating it.
Too many labels can be as problematic as too few, as they reduce clarity
and consistency.

## Code of Conduct for Events

### Event Participation

The Cosmos Simulation project may participate in or host events such as
conferences, meetups, workshops, or virtual gatherings. All participants
in project events are expected to follow this Code of Conduct, just as
they would in online community spaces.

### Event Specific Guidelines

In addition to the general Code of Conduct, event participants should
respect venue rules and policies, be mindful of noise levels and shared
spaces, represent the project positively to external audiences, and
follow any event specific guidelines communicated by organizers.

### Virtual Events

Virtual events have their own considerations. Participants should use
their real names or clearly identified pseudonyms, minimize background
noise and distractions, be patient with technology issues, and respect
the time and attention of other participants.

### Event Representation

Individuals representing the project at external events have additional
responsibilities. They should accurately represent the project's positions
and capabilities, clarify when speaking personally versus representing
the project, and defer to official project communications when appropriate.

## Social Media Guidelines

### Official Social Media Presence

The project maintains official presences on social media platforms.
These accounts are managed by designated project members and follow
these social media guidelines.

### Account Representation

Official accounts should use official project branding and profile
information. Posts should represent the project's official positions
and communications. When sharing third party content, credit the
original source and ensure it aligns with project values.

### Engaging with the Community

Project social media accounts should engage constructively with the
community. This includes responding to questions when appropriate,
acknowledging contributions and achievements, and sharing relevant
updates and announcements.

### Personal Social Media

When project contributors discuss the project on personal social media,
they should clarify that they are speaking personally and not officially
representing the project. This prevents confusion about official project
positions and protects both the individual and the project.

## Third Party Services

### Service Integration

The Cosmos Simulation project may integrate with third party services
for various purposes such as continuous integration, documentation hosting,
or data services. All such integrations should follow these guidelines.

### Service Selection

Before adding a new third party service integration, consider whether
the service is necessary and whether there are alternatives. Evaluate
the service's privacy policy, data handling practices, reliability,
and long term viability. Consider the maintenance burden of the
integration.

### Service Configuration

Service configurations should be documented and should use appropriate
authentication and authorization mechanisms. Sensitive credentials should
never be committed to the repository. Services should be configured to
minimize data exposure and respect user privacy.

### Service Deprecation

When third party services are discontinued or significantly changed,
integrations should be updated or removed. Plan for service transitions
and communicate changes to users in advance when possible.

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Philosophy

Dependencies extend the project's capabilities but also introduce risks
and maintenance burden. Each dependency should be carefully considered
and justified. Prefer minimal dependencies and favor widely adopted,
well maintained packages.

### Adding Dependencies

Before adding a new dependency, search for alternatives and consider
implementing the functionality directly if it is straightforward. When
adding a dependency, review its maintenance status, community size,
security history, and license compatibility. Document the rationale
for the dependency choice.

### Updating Dependencies

Dependencies should be kept reasonably current to benefit from bug fixes
and security updates. However, frequent updates also introduce risk.
Strike a balance between staying current and ensuring stability. Major
version upgrades require more thorough testing and may require code changes.

### Removing Dependencies

Periodically review dependencies for continued necessity. Unused or
unnecessary dependencies should be removed. When removing a dependency,
ensure that any functionality it provided is either replaced or no
longer needed.

## License Compliance

### Understanding Project Licenses

The Cosmos Simulation project uses multiple licenses for different
components. Contributors must understand and respect these licenses.
The main project is licensed under an open source license detailed in
the LICENSE file. Some components may use different licenses.

### License Compatibility

When contributing code or other materials, ensure that your contribution
is compatible with the project's existing licenses. Generally, contributions
to the main codebase should be under the same license as the surrounding
code. If you wish to contribute under different terms, discuss this with
maintainers first.

### Third Party Content

Using third party content (code, images, data, etc.) requires appropriate
licensing and attribution. Never include content without proper license
rights. When including third party content, document its source and license.

### License Headers

Source files should include appropriate license headers. When creating
new files, add the standard license header. When modifying existing files,
preserve existing license headers and add your contribution under the
appropriate terms.

## Trademark Policy

### Attribution

When using project trademarks, provide clear attribution to the project.
This helps maintain trademark rights and ensures users understand they
are dealing with project related activities.

## Privacy Considerations

### User Privacy

The Cosmos Simulation project respects user privacy. The project does
not collect personal information from users without their knowledge and
consent. Any data collection that does occur should be clearly disclosed
and optional where possible.

### Data Minimization

Collect only the data that is necessary for the project's functioning.
Do not collect or store personal information unless essential. When data
must be collected, minimize the amount and duration of storage.

## Escalation and Deescalation Guidelines

### Escalation Path

Violations should be escalated through the following path:

1.   Initial Detection  : Any community member or maintainer may identify
   a potential violation and report it through designated channels.

2.   Initial Assessment  : A designated coordinator reviews the report
   to determine if it constitutes a violation and estimates severity level.

3.   Investigation  : For severity levels 3 and above, an investigation
   is conducted including gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses,
   and reviewing records.

4.   Determination  : After investigation, a determination is made about
   the violation and appropriate consequence.

5.   Notification  : The individual is notified of the determination
   and consequence with full explanation and evidence.

6.   Appeal Process  : For severity levels 5 and above, the individual
   may appeal the decision through the formal appeal process.

### deescalation Considerations

In some cases, deescalation may be appropriate:

* First time violations of low severity may warrant lesser consequences
* Violations stemming from misunderstanding may be resolved through education
* Personal circumstances affecting behavior may be considered
* Demonstrated remorse and commitment to change may reduce consequences
* Genuine efforts at repair and reconciliation may influence decisions

deescalation does not apply to severe violations or repeat offenders.

### Appeal Process

For violations of severity level 5 and above, individuals may appeal:

1.   Written Appeal  : Submit a formal written appeal within 14 days of
   the decision, explaining grounds for appeal.

2.   Review Committee  : An appeal review committee is assembled,
   consisting of project leads not involved in the original decision.

3.   Review Process  : Committee reviews all evidence and hears from
   all parties before rendering a decision.

4.   Outcome  : Committee may uphold, reduce, or increase the original
   consequence. This decision is final for severity levels 5 7.

5.   Further Appeal  : For severity levels 8 10, appeals may be
   considered by external review at the project leads' discretion.

## Reporting Violations

All violations should be reported to ensure community safety:

  Report Email  : conduct@cosmos simulation.example.com

  Emergency Reports  : For urgent security concerns or threats to
safety, contact project leads directly at security@cosmos simulation.example.com

  Reporting Principles  :
- Reports should be made in good faith
- Retaliation against reporters is itself a violation
- All reports are treated confidentially
- Reports are reviewed by trained coordinators
- False reports may result in consequences for the reporter

## Enforcement Team

The code of conduct is enforced by trained coordinators:

  Level 1 2  : Community members and any maintainer
  Level 3 4  : Senior maintainers and coordinators
  Level 5 7  : Project leads with review committee
  Level 8 10  : Project leads with external consultation

All enforcement decisions are documented and tracked for consistency.
